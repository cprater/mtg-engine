mtg-engine
==========

Magic the Gathering engine written in JS. Kind of a hobby project, maybe will be usable for playing.

## Goals

MtG engine with rules enforcement. Additional goals: draft engine, modality for embedding in other games (Shandalar-like Ravni—Åa JS game? Who knows.)

Better understanding of Magic: the Gathering rules.

Experience on prototyping and designing complex Javascript application.

## Does it work?

Not yet.
